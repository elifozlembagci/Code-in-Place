# 🐍 Elif’s Code in Place Journey – 2025 Edition ✨

Hey there! I’m Elif — a curious coder, science enthusiast, and chaos-driven project lover.  
This repository is a collection of all the mini-projects and experiments I’ve built throughout **Code in Place 2025**.

I’m using this space to learn Python, test creative ideas, and prove that programming can absolutely have personality.

## 🧠 What’s this about?

Throughout this journey, I’ll be:
- Building interactive little tools and quizzes
- Learning through play, creativity, and a bit of Python-powered sarcasm
- Documenting each week's progress in my own way

The goal? To explore what I can do when learning code feels like a playground, not a test.  
(And maybe accidentally become the CEO of `print("hello world")` in the process.)

## 📂 What’s inside?

This folder includes:
- 🧪 Mini projects I’ve created each week
- ✨ Small scripts with big vibes
- 📓 Notes, sketches, and ideas worth keeping

Everything here was made with love, curiosity, and probably caffeine ☕  
More will be added week by week as the course continues.

## 📌 Why I’m sharing this

Because learning is cooler when it’s shared.  
And because seeing messy, evolving code in progress > pretending everything is perfect.

If you're learning too — hi! You’re doing amazing. 💛  
If you're here to peek — welcome! Feel free to explore.
