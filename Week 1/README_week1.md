# 🧠 Week 1 – Baby Steps into Python

Welcome to my first official week of Python coding, where I’ve survived bugs, built bots, and made microbiomes talk. Here’s what I tackled:

---

## 🐛 `99 Bugs, 1 Crush.py`
A playful tribute to the classic developer nightmare.  
I wrote a loop that counts bugs, pretends to fix one, and ends in glorious collapse.  
✨ *Skills practiced:* `for` loops, basic math ops, and terminal humor.

---

## ☕ `Coffee Order Bot.py`
A simple chatbot that takes your coffee order like a moody barista.  
✨ *Skills practiced:* `input()`, `print()`, `if/else`, and string formatting.

---

## 🦠 `Which Microbiome Are You?.py`
A fun personality quiz that matches you to a microbiome type (yes, I’m serious).  
✨ *Skills practiced:* conditional logic, return values, text styling, and creativity.

---

## 👵 `Who You Calling Old?.py`
Checks your age and gives you an aggressively honest life advice.  
✨ *Skills practiced:* casting (`int()`), boolean logic, and branching.

## 💭 Reflections

- 🔰 First week with `Python` – and it feels both chaotic and amazing.  
- 🧩 Most confusing moment: forgetting to cast strings to integers.  
- 🪄 Most fun: turning science into jokes in the microbiome quiz.
